A capping constraint is a way of restricting how many times an option is proposed. These restrictions can be applied in two ways.

One of the ways is by setting a cap globally. This means that the option won't be proposed more than the set cap regardless to whom the option is proposed (subject of the recommendation). This is also referred to as volume-based capping.

Another way is by setting a cap per profile. An option is often proposed to some profile (subject of the recommendation). A marketer may want to limit the number of times the same profile gets the recommendation. This is also referred to as user-fatigue capping.

A marketer can set both these caps on an option at the same time.
